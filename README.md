# Game Template

This is a really simple game template.

When you download it, make sure to run `npm install` first and foremost.
All game code is located in the `game` directory. 
Textures go in `/public/textures`. As far as I know, they can be any image format including SVGs.

To run the game, do the following:
```bash
npm run build
node .
```

Open the browser to the URL printed in the console.

## Tip:
If you add the `/` folder to the Chrome DevTools Overrides panel, you get automatic refresh.
